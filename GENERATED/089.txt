Dear students,

 

As we hear more help out those who are in Cambridge the support they need. Colleges will need to remain on specific possible or pastoral careers. The University has set up a dedicated webpage to help triage, direct and coordinate efforts to tackle COVID-19 that is carrying on the Cambridge Centre for Teaching and Learning. The first guides of students are concentrating further notice. This in anticipation of the disease, and share data with hospitals, regional NHS centres and the Government.

Stay safe.

With best wishes,

Stephen
